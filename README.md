Source code for the ZX Spectrum Next

L2 Scroller example v2 by em00k

source code that uses the copper to scroll a scroller plotted to L2. 
the dma also is used to update a copper list on each vlbank.

there are some tests for snaking data quickly to L2 but so far I found
typewriter method to be quickest. i have not yet tried using the dma 
to blast lines but may update to that.
